			<h3>An Auto-Biography by Juwan Taylor</h3>

			<p>My name is Juwan Taylor, but my friends call me JT. I am 19 going on 20 years old in August. I am a junior at The University Of Georgia. Also I play linebacker. I am family oriented. Everything I possibly do in life I do it for my mom, Dad, My three brothers, and my twin sister. 
			</p>

			<p>
			My sister and me are close, I can consider her as my little pit bull because She is Loyal, Beautiful, vicious, and stubborn. My sister has been by my side through the fights & Adversity.  She taught me the importance of being in school. Sports play a huge role in my life. I was always a big kid compared to others. My dad introduces me to the game of football when I was just four years of age.  
			</p>

			<p>
			I immediately fell in love with the game. What led to me to fall in love with football is the grind, all the hard practices and off season workouts that leads you to win games during the season. The offseason training is for to help you overcome adversity when the monkey actually jump on your back during a championship game. The game of football you have to be more mentally strong then physical.  I remember when we use to run twenty 110m sprints. If you did not come that day with the right mentality you already have been defeated. At first I use approach our run workouts with the wrong mindset and I will be defeated because my body was heeding to my mind saying I cant do this, I cant do this! Once I learned how to fight through the adversity mentally I became a better player and a better student.
